The sum of the net worth of the individuals cannot exceed the sum of the value of the art on a given side of the river.

$A_{20} B_{12}$ & | | & $C_{8}$ & \emph{C would cross the river with C's painting} \\

\section*{2 new people arrive}

\subsection*{e}
Send Carol back because Elisha and Carol's net worth is equal to Dave's Statue. 

\subsection*{f}
A and B must leave with their artwork.

\section*{Part B}
\subsection*{a}
Yes it is possible to AAA in to AAABC. The conversion is very simple:
\newline
AAA \quad -\textgreater \quad BC (Rule 3) %output AAA -> BC
\newline
BC \quad -\textgreater \quad AAAC (Rule 1) %output BC -> AAAC
\newline
AAAC \quad -\textgreater \quad AAAAAA (Rule 2) %output AAAC -> AAAAAA
\newline
AAAAAA \quad -\textgreater \quad AAABC (Rule 3) %output AAAAAA -> AAABC


\subsection*{b}
Using the rules 3, 1, and 2, in that order will add 3 As to any set of 3+ As. Using this knowledge going from eight As to 29 is just repeating rules 3, 1, and 2 7 times and you will have 29 As.

\subsection*{c}
Using the rules given the amount of As will only increment by 3. Due to this fact it would not be possible to get from 11 to 31.
